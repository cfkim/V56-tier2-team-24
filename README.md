# Beacon ‚òÄÔ∏è
Supporting your loved ones in every step of the surgery process, made easier.
## üí¨ Purpose
This app displays the status of ongoing surgeries from check-in to recovery so that patient family/friends can be in the loop at every step, from anywhere --- not just the waiting room.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Major Functions
- Surgical Team Members can update the status of ongoing surgeries (i.e. Checked-in, In-progress, etc.)
- Guests can view a status board of all ongoing operations without needing to create an account
- Patient information is protected, to ensure anonymity and HIPAA compliance (guests for the patient will know their patient #, which is displayed on the board)

## üì¶ Dependencies

This project follows a typical MERN stack setup:

- **MongoDB** ‚Äì Database
	*The database for the live website is hosted on MongoDB Atlas*
- **Express** ‚Äì Back-end framework
- **React (with Vite)** ‚Äì Front-end library + build tool
- **Node.js** ‚Äì runs the Express server

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project
View the live site [here]
1. Prerequisites
Node.js version **18.17.0** or higher

2. Installation -- within each folder (server and client)
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up your Environment Variables

- `server/.env` > `MONGO_URI=`  
  You can set up a Mongo database **locally** or through the cloud with **MongoDB Atlas**. Change the `MONGO_URI` variable in the `server/.env` file accordingly.

- `server/.env` > `APP_ORIGIN=`  
  Ensure that the `APP_ORIGIN` variable is set to the URL of your running client (i.e. `APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173`).

- `client/.env` > `VITE_API_URL=`  
  Ensure that the `VITE_API_URL` variable is set to the URL where you are running the server (i.e. `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4004`).


4. Start/Run the project locally  
In separate terminals, to run back-end and front-end simultaneously:

`client` folder
```bash
npm run dev
```
`server` folder
```bash
npm run devStart
```
View the now locally hosted website at your client url (i.e. https://localhost:5173)

5. Deployment
Rails or Render are popular deployment options since it has the ability to host all three main parts of an application (front-end, back-end, and database)
